# Portfolio Website Redesign

## 📌 Overview

This project is a redesign and implementation of a portfolio website based on provided reference screenshots. The goal of the assignment was to accurately recreate the design layout, styling, and structure using modern web technologies, with an emphasis on responsive design and code readability.

Our team worked collaboratively to match the look and functionality of the original screenshots, ensuring the site is consistent across different screen sizes and browsers.

## 🚀 Solution Approach
1. **Analysis of Provided Screenshots**  
   Carefully reviewed each screenshot to understand layout structure, font choices, color schemes, and component behavior.

2. **Component Breakdown**  
   Broke the design into sections (e.g., header, hero, about, projects, contact) and assigned components to team members for efficiency.

3. **Testing & Refinement**  
   Cross-checked the site layout against the original screenshots and performed browser/device testing to ensure consistency.
